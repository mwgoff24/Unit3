1.  Practice importing random** — Use randint with different arguments. Simulate a dice roll, printing out to the user what number they rolled.

2.  Look at the documentation of the random library — Experiment with another function (not randint) that returns a value.

3.  Create a program that simulates a magic 8-ball​
    1.  Store all of the 8-ball's possible responses (shown below) in a list

    2.  Have the program prompt the user to ask the magic 8-ball a question

        then return and print a random response.
